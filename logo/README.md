# Logo

The `fablabs-ch.svg` file is the reference logo in a vector graphics format. The
images in the `bitmap` folder are exported from it at different scales in order
to be used/linked where vector graphics are not supported.

## Editing

The logo in vector graphics format can be edited with
[Inkscape][], a free and open-source vector graphics
editor (GPL). This software can also be used to export vector graphics into
bitmap.
