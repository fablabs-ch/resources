# Logo

The `fablabs-ch.svg` file is the logo in a vector graphics format and it is the
reference logo. The images in the `bitmap` folder are exported from it at
different scales in order to be used/linked where vector graphics are not
supported.

## Editing

The logo in vector graphics format can be edited with
[`Inkscape`](https://inkscape.org/en/), an open-source software (GPL). This
software can also be used to export vector graphics into bitmap.
